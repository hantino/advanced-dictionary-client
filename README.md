# advanced-dictionary-client

#####The simple-dictionary-client on paper (Polymer Paper) 

Using [GWT](http://www.gwtproject.org) and [Polymer Paper Elements](https://elements.polymer-project.org/), advanced-dictionary-client is basically the front-end interface of the [simple-dictionary-client](https://github.com/hantino/simple-dictionary-client).

This web application uses [GWT-Polymer-Elements](https://github.com/vaadin/gwt-polymer-elements) with [UiBinder](http://www.gwtproject.org/doc/latest/DevGuideUiBinder.html) to transform the command line client to a Web Application.
